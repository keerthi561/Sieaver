**Sieaver**

This is a fintech based android application which helps the users to invest money in mutual funds , setting goals and helps the user 
to minimize the tax incurred on their earnings. Following are the functions that are incorporated inside the app.
Sieaver comes from two words: SIP + Beaver.The app is based on Systematic Investment Plan and just like a Beaver it helps to save small amount of money day by day.

Firstly to invest in SIP's , one needs to have their PAN Number and the person should be KYC certified. With the help of a few services
such as Karvy it will be checked whether the user is kyc certified or not and then if not then the app will contain options to KYC certify himself
by Adhaar and other means as well!Isn't that cool. All the process will be done by the backend.

1) **Beaver Saver**

Beaver is a rodent which tries to save small amounts of walnuts day by day .
Getting inspired by the very animal,I have decided to incorporate this feature wherein small amounts of money which will be decided by the user will be debited from the bank account every week and invested in the mututal fund
which we think will be best for the user.A variety of mututal funds will be listed which will include the risk factor involved in investing in that particular fund and also the past performances of that fund.The user can then choose the fund and fund will be invested directly.
The funds that will be listed will be liquid funds into which the money will be invested.

Advantages of this over saving normally in banks are as follows:
The money will grow in the mutual funds at a rate of 6-7% instead of the usual 3% which is offered in the bank accounts.Isnt't tha amazing!

2) **Goal setting**

Being an engineer , I always have dreams and aspirations of going to Goa along with my friends.But.......!"Paise ki kami hai bro" line comes out
every time . Getting motivated to solve this particular problem , I have decided to incorporate this feature where the user will be able to save particular
sum of money and invest in Debt funds and slowly and steadily the money will grow which can be monitored by the app..And there will come a time 
when the goal will be reached and then plan a trip to Goa!The user will need to enter the amount of money he requires to achieve a particular goal and 
and the app will show the time it will take to achieve it.
The money will be invested in debt funds of the mutual funds category .The reason behind this is that the interest rates on debt funds remain same for a period of months and so the user will be getting constant money each time.

3) **Bash the Tax**

Getting away from the axe of the tax is always a matter of concern.The app will let you know where to invest such as in PPF , Narional Savings certificate.
Life insurance etc. and it will help the user in getting away from the axe tax.
This would use the equity funds.

Many more features will be added later on!Stay tuned.
